  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am a Web Designer/Developer (newly hired!) with a passion for awesome looking websites and a fascination with how they work. For the last few years, whilst studying, I have been working for myself doing graphic/web design along with CMS and custom built sites for clients.</p>
  <p>The most important people in my life are my Mum, Dad and Hubby, they are my best friends and biggest support!</p>

 	<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
   <p>I grew up in <strong>Perth, Western Australia,</strong> with <strong>beautiful white sandy beaches</strong> and summer that seemed to last for six months a year. After a year of travelling to UK and Europe and living in Bath, England, I returned to Australia and moved to the <strong>beautiful and vibrant Sydney.</strong></p>

 	<h1>More About Me</h1>
   <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
   <p><strong>Love my sports</strong> - tennis, golf, horse-riding. I love camping, fishing, snorkelling, road trips to see new, beautiful places. <strong>Wine and food</strong> are definitely favourite hobbies too :)</p>

   <h2>What’s your dream job?</h2>
   <p>Dolphin trainer.. no just kidding.. Front End Developer. I love learning coding, to me it is exciting, fascinating, challenging, frustrating and satisfying with an infinite amount of learning and growing skills to keep me engaged and excited about work.</p>
 
   <h2>What’s your background?</h2>
<p>I worked as an Event Manager for various places such as a golf course, hotels, casino and catering and also had some time in the wine industry. If someone told me then I would be able to build a website from scratch I would thought there is no way I could do that! But my interest in websites lead me to study and a big lesson that you should always try, otherwise you won't know. </p>
   
   <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>

	<p>We've been having some Friday fun with Mashup music lately, some tacky but funny ones and others just amazing how two completely different songs from different eras sound awesome together. I love the creativity.<p>
